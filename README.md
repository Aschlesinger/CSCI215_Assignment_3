## Responsive.html 

Make your course website responsive:
When the width of the window is less than 1000 pixels, its contents should be a picture that is right justified, something like: 

The pic should be a link so that when it is clicked, your nav links appear in a vertically arranged list. 
See the http://www.cofc.edu homepage for an example of what you need to do. 
You must figure this out from scratch (WRITE YOUR OWN CODE!) based on what we did in class, and using the onResize/onLoad event handlers, and window.outerWidth property. 

## picViewer.html

Using only what you have learned in class, create a webpage that displays 5 thumbnail (small) images, and then when you click on then, a large version is displayed on the page with a pop-out div that includes a picture of a close-pop-out-div icon in the upper left corner. When the user clicks the icon, the pop out div goes away. (becomes back “hidden”… So, the div is always there, but you are manipulating the hidden attribute).

## CountDown.html

Using only what you have learned in class, create a webpage that has two divs on it: input and output. Only the input div is editable. On the webpage state: “You are only allowed to enter 50 characters in the input box.”. Above the output div have text that says “Number of characters remaining:” and inside the output div, display the number of characters the user can still enter in the input div. So, at the beginning, the output div would have “50” in it. If the user types in a character in the input div, you should automatically see the output div turn to “49”… If the number of characters left goes to a negative number, change the font color in the output div to red.

On the webpage state: “You are only allowed to enter 50 characters in the input box.”. Above the output div have text that says “Number of characters remaining” and inside the output div, display the number of characters the user can still enter in the input div, but you must use the following pics to display the number:


So, at the beginning, the output div would have this in it:



If the user types in a character in the input div, you should automatically see the output div turn to:

When the user has entered 50 characters and you are displaying the 0 bumblebee picture, do not allow the user to enter any additional characters.   

THIS IS INDIVIDUAL WORK ONLY. Place all of your files inside of one .ZIP file and upload it to DropBox. So, only 1 file should be uploaded to DropBox.
